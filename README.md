# c-sketch
Sometimes, I code to improve my skill. This is the result of what I've learned.
## Usage
Just open terminal and ```make <filename>``` then execute binary ```./<filename>``` very easy. <br>
For windows, you have to compile directly. Because Windows doesn't support makefile.<br>
In the future, I might use cmake instead.
## License
