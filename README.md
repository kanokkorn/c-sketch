Sometimes, I code to improve my skill. This is the result of what I've learned.
## Usage
Just open terminal and ```make <filename>``` then execute binary ```./<filename>``` very easy. <br>
For windows, you have to compile directly. Because Windows doesn't support makefile.<br>
In the future, I might use cmake instead.
## Another Usage ,duh
Compile it by yourself, use ```gcc``` or [this](https://clang.llvm.org/) and type ```filename``` maybe this will(?) do the job.

## License
It's just an example files. So [no license](https://github.com/kanokkorn/c-sketch/blob/master/LICENSE)
